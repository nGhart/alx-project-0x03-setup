# Splash App

## Project Description

**Splash App** is a scalable Next.js application designed to serve as a **clean, professional foundation** for building modern, AI-powered web features.

This project demonstrates core industry best practices, focusing on **component-based architecture, efficient shared layouts, and comprehensive type safety.** It provides a production-ready structure that can be easily extended for features like text generation tools or image conversion applications.

The application ensures a **consistent branding and responsive design** across all devices, mimicking the requirements of real-world, maintainable software development.

## Key Features & Learning Objectives

This project is structured to teach and reinforce essential modern web development techniques:

### Architectural Best Practices
* **Shared Layouts (DRY):** Implement reusable `Header`, `Footer`, and `Layout` components to avoid code duplication.
* **Component Architecture:** Structure components for maximum modularity and reusability (e.g., dedicated `Button` component).
* **Project Structure:** Learn to organize code, interfaces, and styling following industry best practices for maintainability.

### Core Technologies
* **Next.js Routing:** Implement both **declarative** and **imperative** navigation techniques.
* **TypeScript:** Enforce type safety across the entire application, including props and state, using custom interfaces.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Apply the utility-first framework for rapid, responsive styling with **custom Google Fonts** integration.

### User Experience & Stability
* **Responsive Design:** Ensure the UI dynamically adapts and looks professional on all screen sizes.
* **Custom Error Handling:** Create a user-friendly custom **404 error page** for improved UX.
